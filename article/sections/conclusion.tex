\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents an approach to minimize the complexity of security static analyzers by using a \astname{} and a common core module to detect vulnerabilities. The solution was implemented in a tool called \toolname{} using Java with parsers and tree walkers generated by ANTLR4. The evaluation against several web applications shows that our tool is able to detect vulnerabilities while being portable.
