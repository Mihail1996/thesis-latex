I had the pleasure of spending the last 5 years as a student of Instituto Superior Técnico. Throughout this period, I had the opportunity to learn and evolve a lot, not only from a technical standpoint but also from a personal one. For this reason, I am very grateful to the university and all my professors.

During the time I was doing my MSc thesis, Prof. João Pereira and Prof. Miguel Pupo Correia were always willing and available to help and discuss the choices I was making. I am deeply grateful for all the advice, time spent helping me, and all the feedback given on my work. 

Also, I must thank my family and friends for all the support received. Finally, I want to thank Miguel Ferreira who took the time to read this work to help with the writing.
